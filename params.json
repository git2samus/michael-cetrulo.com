There's also some personal projects that you can find on my [Github account](https://github.com/git2samus).\r\n\r\n## My work\r\n\r\nFor the most part of my career I've been involved on Web Development and Web-related projects such as Screen Scraping, APIs, etc. and even ventured on some DevOps tasks but my core skill is being a Full-Stack Web Developer leaning on the Backend side.\r\n\r\nThe last few years of my career I've got involved on BigData projects with frameworks such as [Hadoop](https://hadoop.apache.org/), [Storm](https://storm.apache.org/) and some more and I'm now getting interested in some Machine Learning problems and technologies.\r\n\r\nI'm proficient in the [Python](https://www.python.org/) and [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/) programming languages, which are the ones I use more often; I'm also skilled on [JavaScript](https://www.javascript.com/), [PHP](https://secure.php.net/) and [Java](https://www.java.com/).\r\n\r\nI'm interested in functional programming as well, having some knowledge of [Erlang](http://www.erlang.org/) and [Clojure](http://clojure.org/). \r\n\r\n## My services\r\n\r\nI'm offering my services as an independent contractor/consultant on an hourly basis through a legally registered company here in Uruguay.\r\n\r\nI accept full-time and part-time offers but I prefer to work full-time, for small projects we use individual hours at a slightly higher hourly rate.\r\n\r\nI'll be glad to adjust myself to the methodology of your company, for individuals I propose to work based on Sprints which are two-week units of work including: a planning session at the beginning to define the scope, a review at the end of the first week and a demonstration at the end of the second week.\r\n\r\nAfter finishing a Sprint there will be seven days in which the results can be evaluated and bug reports can be submitted for the features covered in that scope, those bugs will be fixed without additional charges and new features and/or out-of-scope modifications will be included on the next Sprint and charged accordingly.\r\n\r\n## Contact\r\n\r\nYou can reach me via email at contact@michael-cetrulo.com to schedule a call, my Skype is samus_uy and my number +598.99.564.670 here in Uruguay.\r\n\r\n### Note to recruiters\r\n\r\nI'll be glad to receive any offers/proposals you'd like me to consider and I'll review each one however I'll only reply to those I want to discuss further, thank you.\r\n\r\n## On the web\r\n\r\nHere's some other places where you can find me:\r\n\r\n### Professional\r\n\r\n* Toptal - [toptal.com/resume/michael-cetrulo](http://www.toptal.com/resume/michael-cetrulo#hire-only-tested-developers)\r\n* LinkedIn - [linkedin.com/in/web2samus](https://www.linkedin.com/in/web2samus)\r\n* Careers - [careers.stackoverflow.com/web2samus](https://careers.stackoverflow.com/web2samus)\r\n* AngelList - [angel.co/michael-cetrulo](https://angel.co/michael-cetrulo)\r\n* Github - [github.com/git2samus](https://github.com/git2samus)\r\n* Bitbucket - [bitbucket.org/git2samus](https://bitbucket.org/git2samus]\r\n\r\n### Personal\r\n\r\n* Facebook - [facebook.com/fb2samus](https://www.facebook.com/fb2samus)\r\n* Twitter - [twitter.com/gonna_hate](https://twitter.com/gonna_hate)\r\n* Reddit - [reddit.com/user/Samus_](https://www.reddit.com/user/Samus_)\r\n","google":"UA-67918909-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
